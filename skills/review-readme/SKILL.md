# Review README

Analyze and improve a project's README to be useful, brief, and visually attractive.

## Core Principle: The 30-Second Rule

A developer must understand **what this project is** and **how to start using it** within 30 seconds. Everything else is secondary. When in doubt, cut.

## Instructions

1. Read README.md and scan the project (manifests, configs, Makefile, docs/, git remote URL)
2. Run all checks below, classifying findings as **ISSUE** / **IMPROVE** / **STYLE**
3. Present findings table, ask the user which to apply, then make changes

## Structure Check

**Target: ≤6 top-level sections.** Evaluate against the essential skeleton:

| Section | Rule |
|---------|------|
| **Title + one-liner** | ≤15 words answering "What does this do?" directly under H1 |
| **Badges** | Single row: build, version, license — only if real data exists. Use shields.io with actual repo URL |
| **Quick Start** | Zero to running in **≤3 copy-pasteable steps**. Most important section |
| **Usage** | Primary use case with one code example |
| **License** | SPDX identifier or link. Bottom of file |

Optional sections — add **only** when clearly needed:

| Section | When |
|---------|------|
| Features | 3+ distinct capabilities — bullets, not paragraphs |
| Screenshot/GIF | Visual UI exists |
| Configuration | Show **minimal** example (≤15 lines), link to full reference |
| API Reference | 1-2 examples only, link to full docs |
| Contributing | Or just link to CONTRIBUTING.md |

**Anti-patterns:** ToC under 200 lines, >6 sections, separate "About"/"Introduction" when one-liner suffices, empty/boilerplate sections, backstory ("Started in 2023...").

## Content Audit

### Accuracy
- [ ] Every command is runnable (verify against actual scripts, Makefile, package.json)
- [ ] File paths, ports, URLs, container names match the repo
- [ ] Prerequisites are current; project name capitalization is consistent

### Brevity — Cut Before Adding

**Key discipline.** The natural tendency is to expand. Resist it.

- [ ] One-liner ≤15 words — no filler ("designed to be", "aims to provide")
- [ ] Quick Start ≤3 steps, copy-pasteable commands (not descriptions of steps)
- [ ] No paragraph >3 sentences; no section >~40 lines — move excess to docs/
- [ ] Cut filler: "This section describes...", "has been continuously improved"
- [ ] Single install method as default; alternatives in `<details>` collapsible
- [ ] Config examples: **minimum required keys only** — not every option
- [ ] API docs: 1-2 representative endpoints — link to full reference

### Completeness (flag only if genuinely missing)
- [ ] Answers: What? How to install? How to use?
- [ ] CLI: at least one command with output. Library: one import + usage example

## Visual Check

- [ ] **Above the fold** (first ~25 lines): title, one-liner, badges, Quick Start — nothing else
- [ ] Code blocks have language tags; single H1; no skipped heading levels
- [ ] Long optional content in `<details><summary>` collapsibles
- [ ] Break text walls with bullets, tables, or code blocks

## Report & Apply

Present findings:

```
| # | Sev     | Phase     | Finding                                              |
|---|---------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | ISSUE   | Structure | Missing one-liner — title is bare project name        |
| 2 | IMPROVE | Brevity   | Config section is 45 lines — show minimal, link docs  |
| 3 | STYLE   | Visual    | Code blocks missing language tags on lines 34, 67     |
```

Use AskUserQuestion with options: "All", "ISSUE + IMPROVE only", "Let me pick". After applying, show before/after summary.

**Key constraint: Never grow the README to fix it.** If adding content, cut or collapse something first. The goal is *shorter and better*, not longer and more complete.
