# GitHub Workflow Audit

Systematic review of all GitHub Actions workflow files in a repository for errors, outdated actions, security issues, and improvement opportunities.

## Instructions

When invoked, find all `.github/workflows/*.yml` and `.github/workflows/*.yaml` files in the repository using the Glob tool. Read every workflow file. Then run every check section below in order.

For each finding, report severity: **ERROR** (will break the workflow), **WARN** (likely bug, security risk, or outdated), or **INFO** (improvement suggestion). At the end, provide a summary table and offer to fix all issues.

## 1. YAML Syntax & Structure

Read each workflow file and check:

- [ ] Valid YAML — run `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('<file>'))"` or `yq '.' <file>` via Bash tool to verify parse
- [ ] Every workflow has a `name:` field
- [ ] Every workflow has an `on:` trigger defined
- [ ] Every job has a `runs-on:` field (unless it uses `uses:` for reusable workflows)
- [ ] Step `uses:` values follow the format `owner/repo@ref` or `./.github/workflows/file.yml`
- [ ] Reusable workflows referenced via `uses: ./.github/workflows/*.yml` actually exist — cross-check against discovered workflow files
- [ ] `workflow_call` inputs declared in reusable workflows match what callers pass via `with:`
- [ ] `secrets:` declared in reusable workflows match what callers pass via `secrets:`
- [ ] No YAML anchors/aliases used incorrectly

## 2. Action Version Check

For every `uses:` reference that pins to a version tag (e.g. `actions/checkout@v4`):

1. Extract the owner, repo, and current ref
2. For GitHub-hosted actions, fetch the latest release:
   ```bash
   curl -sI -o /dev/null -w "%{url_effective}" -L "https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/latest"
   ```
3. Compare the pinned major version against the latest major version
4. Report **WARN** for outdated major versions (e.g. `@v3` when `@v4` is available)
5. Report **INFO** for outdated minor/patch versions within the same major (e.g. `@v4.1.0` when `@v4.2.0` exists) — only if pinned to a full semver, not just a major tag

Note: Pinning to a major version tag like `@v4` is standard practice and is considered current as long as the major version is latest.

## 3. Security Review

Check for common security anti-patterns:

- [ ] **Expression injection** — `${{ github.event.inputs.* }}`, `${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}`, or other user-controlled context values used directly in `run:` blocks without quoting. These allow arbitrary command injection. Flag as **ERROR** if the value is interpolated into a shell command. Flag as **WARN** if used in a `with:` parameter (less dangerous but still risky with untrusted PRs)
- [ ] **Overly broad permissions** — `permissions: write-all` or no permissions block at all (defaults to broad). Suggest least-privilege `permissions:` block
- [ ] **Secrets in logs** — secrets echoed or used in ways that could leak to logs (e.g. `echo ${{ secrets.KEY }}`)
- [ ] **Mutable action references** — `uses:` pinned to a branch like `@main` or `@master` instead of a tag or SHA. Report **WARN** — these can change without notice
- [ ] **StrictHostKeyChecking no** — SSH steps that disable host key verification. Report **INFO** for CI contexts (common but worth noting)
- [ ] **Hardcoded credentials** — API keys, tokens, passwords, or IP addresses hardcoded in workflow files instead of using secrets. Note: default input values for manual `workflow_dispatch` triggers (like default server IPs) are **INFO** level, not errors

## 4. Logic & Correctness

- [ ] `if:` conditions use correct syntax — e.g. `${{ inputs.foo == 'bar' }}` not `${{ inputs.foo }} == 'bar'`
- [ ] `env:` variables set via `>> $GITHUB_ENV` use correct syntax and are available in subsequent steps (not same step)
- [ ] Artifact names are unique across jobs when using `upload-artifact` / `download-artifact`
- [ ] `needs:` dependencies between jobs form a valid DAG (no cycles, referenced jobs exist)
- [ ] `continue-on-error:` is used intentionally and not masking real failures
- [ ] Steps that depend on files from previous steps have proper ordering
- [ ] Inputs accessed via `${{ inputs.* }}` vs `${{ github.event.inputs.* }}` — within `workflow_call` use `inputs.*`; within `workflow_dispatch` both work but should be consistent within the same file
- [ ] Reusable workflow `with:` values match expected types (string, boolean, number) — e.g. passing a boolean to a string input or vice versa

## 5. Cross-Workflow Consistency

When multiple workflows exist:

- [ ] Caller workflows pass all `required: true` inputs to reusable workflows
- [ ] Secret names used in callers match declarations in the reusable workflow
- [ ] Shared patterns (input definitions, secret references) are consistent across caller workflows
- [ ] No orphaned workflows — reusable workflows are actually referenced by at least one caller
- [ ] Runner versions are consistent (`ubuntu-latest` vs pinned versions) — report **INFO** if mixed

## 6. Improvement Suggestions

Look for opportunities to improve workflows:

- [ ] Repeated step blocks across workflows that could be extracted into a reusable workflow or composite action
- [ ] Missing `timeout-minutes:` on jobs (default is 360 minutes / 6 hours — usually too long)
- [ ] Missing `concurrency:` group to prevent duplicate runs
- [ ] Jobs that could run in parallel but are serialized with `needs:`
- [ ] Large `run:` blocks that could be extracted into scripts for easier testing and maintenance

## Summary Format

After all checks, output:

```
| #  | Severity | File | Line(s) | Issue |
|----|----------|------|---------|-------|
| 1  | ERROR    | reusable-deploy.yml | 68 | Expression injection: unquoted ${{ inputs.keyreplace }} in shell case statement |
| 2  | WARN     | deploy.yml | 45 | actions/checkout@v3 is outdated (latest: v4) |
| 3  | INFO     | reusable-deploy.yml | 41 | Missing timeout-minutes on deploy job |
| ...| ...      | ...  | ...     | ... |
```

Then list **actionable fixes** grouped by severity (ERROR first), and offer to apply all fixes.
